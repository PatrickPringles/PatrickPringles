- 👋 Hi, I’m @PatrickPringles
- 👀 I’m interested in software applications, hardware devices such as computers and smartphones, and also trying to learn more in C++ even though it is hard.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data structures and algorithms in C++. I am also learning Java, Python, SQL, and a bit of Assembly all at the same time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on none so far unless I take an interest in a specific software program.
